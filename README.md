NieR:AutoModSave v0.1 by jimmyazrael
This script will guide and help you to import Nier:A's saves shared by others.

Requirement:
1. Preferably you should have received the whole save folder,
or at least you should have the following files:
    GameData.bat, one or more than one of the SlotData files
    and probably SystemData.dat. Although the use of SystemData.dat
    is still unknown.
2. Please make sure you back up your own save folder, as using other's 
save file will make yours unreadable. If you would like to use your save files 
again, simply treat your own backup save folder as the one shared by someone else
and repeat the very same steps stated below.

Steps:
1. Back up your WHOLE save folder, which is likely located at Documents\My Games\NieR_Automata ;
2. Remove everything except Graphic.ini in that folder;
3. Put the files (except Graphic.ini) you received from another player in the folder;
if you prefer exe:
    4. Put NierAutoModSave.exe in the same folder, run it, follow it, done.
else if you prefer .py script and you have Python installed:
    4. Put NierAutoModSave.py in the same folder and run it, follow it, done.
